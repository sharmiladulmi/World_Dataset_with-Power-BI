# Analysis of World Dataset

### Introduction:
In this report, I analyze a comprehensive world dataset comprising three tables: City, Country, and Country Language. Utilizing Power BI, I import the data from a MySQL database, create a data model highlighting inter-table relationships, perform data transformations, and generate visualizations to derive meaningful insights.
